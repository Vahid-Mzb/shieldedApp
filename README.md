# Namada Shielded App

I've developed an application that allows for effortless shielded swaps. With this app, users can create wallets, transfer OSMO from Namada to Osmosis, exchange it for USDC, and then transfer it back to a shielded account in Namada. This app simplifies transactions and swapping and the need for users to interact with the CLI directly. The swapping functionality is powered by OsmoJS.This app, currently built with ElectronJS, has been tested on Linux machines but can also be developed for other platforms.
